# JavaScript in in2publish_core

In in2publish_core we try to use as less as possible JavaScript to accomplish our goals but still build a good UI with good UX.

There are a few JavaScript files, which are used in different places:

* BackendModule.js contains JavaScript used in all backend modules
* PageModuleJquery.js wraps around jQuery for TYPO3 lower than 7.6

Most of the JavaScript actually belongs to the enterprise version and will be removed eventually.
