# Extension Installation

The installation boils down to three simple steps on both Local and Foreign:

1. Copy the source code to typo3conf/ext/in2publish (Please see the in2code GitHub tutorial for more details).
2. Activate the Extension via Extension Manager
3. Open the in2publish extension configuration and set the path to your **Configuration.yaml** files (see next chapter for details).

## New modules on local
