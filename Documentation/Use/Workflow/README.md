# Workflows

In addition to the simple way you can enable workflows in the content publisher.
Workflows are intended for scenarios where changes shall be double checked by a second person and maybe published by yet another person.
To activate the workflow feature please switch it on in the configuration file.

**Workflows is a special feature, which is only available in the enterprise version.**
If you want to know what they do you still can read parts of the documentation here.
